# Project Proposal (3%)
<a name="proposal"></a>
**Due Tuesday, May 29 11:00am**

No more than one page total, with a title and 3	sections, as described below:

### Biological Question
1 paragraph describing the scientific question you are trying to answer. no citations are required for the proposal.
### Dataset
1 paragraph describing the dataset used, which must meet the requirements specified above. Your description must include:

* A description of what the data is (e.g. whole genome-sequencing, RNA-seq, the library set up, which organism, etc.)
* The accession numbers (e.g., SRA numbers)
* Data file sizes and formats
* Publications linked with the data

### Bioinformatics pipeline
1 paragraph *briefly* summarizing how you plan to analyze the data. It is ok if you don't have every single detail yet. However, for your final report, your pipeline:

* Must use at least 5 different software tools that contribute to the analysis. Downloading data soes not count, nor do sub-commands within a single piece of software or trivial commands (e.g. `cp`).
* One of the software tools must be either: (1) a tool we haven't used in class, which you either install yourself or use a web version of or (2) an executable script (not just plotting) that you wrote for this project.

### Proposal scoring

Proposals are scored out of 6 points:

* 1pt: Title, spelling, and grammar
* 2pts: data meets guidelines above
* 2pts: scientific question is clearly stated and makes sense to analyze using the chosen dataset
* 1pt: Proposed pipeline seems plausible to complete in 2 weeks and demonstrates thought
